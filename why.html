    <h2>Why I prefer dogs over cats</h2>
<p>Dogs are better than cats for multiple different reasons. Dogs are better than cats becuase they are mans best friend. Dogs are also better than cats becuase they are loyal. You can teach dogs tricks like sit and shake. Meanwhile cats on the other hand are not as easily trained as dogs and not as loyal as dogs </p>
